//! Delegation to the external `skills` CLI (https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).
//!
//! Skills installed by that CLI live in `~/.agents/skills/<name>` and are tracked
//! in `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` (recording each skill's `skillFolderHash` +
//! source). When Open Agent Config updates such a skill itself, it rewrites the canonical
//! files but cannot update that lockfile's hash, so the two tools drift.
//!
//! Instead we hand the *update* to the `skills` CLI, which rewrites the files AND
//! its own lockfile in one step. We never parse or write `.skill-lock.json` — the
//! tool that owns the format owns the bookkeeping. When the CLI is unavailable the
//! caller falls back to Open Agent Config's own deploy (the lockfile, if it was synced
//! from another machine, self-heals the next time the CLI runs there).
//!
//! Delete is intentionally NOT delegated: OAC's delete is agent/path-granular,
//! whereas `skills remove` always removes from every agent. Removing a per-agent
//! symlink doesn't touch the CLI's canonical `~/.agents` copy (no lockfile drift),
//! so native removal is both safe and more precise.
